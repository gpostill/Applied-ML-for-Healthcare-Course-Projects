# **Applied Machine Learning for Healthcare Course Projects** 

This repository contains scripts and resources related to projects completed as part of the Applied Machine Learning for Healthcare course. The projects focus on using machine learning techniques to solve real-world healthcare problems, with an emphasis on practical applications and data-driven insights.

This repositor include the following: 
  **1. Datathons.** This section contains scripts and notebooks from various healthcare Datathons, where rapid machine learning solutions are developed to address specific challenges in the field. These projects were done in groups and include: 

  **2. Final Project:** The final project prediction of premature mortality. This project was done in collaboration with Dr. Ijeoma Itany. It includes the following components:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model development and training
Evaluation of model performance using healthcare-specific metrics
Insights and findings from the analysis
Problem statements
Data sources and preprocessing steps
Model development and results
Getting Started
To run the scripts, youâ€™ll need to:
