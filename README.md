# **Applied Machine Learning for Healthcare Course Projects** 

This repository contains scripts and resources related to projects completed as part of the Applied Machine Learning for Healthcare course. The course (CHL5230) was instructed by Dr. Zahra Shakeri. The projects focus on using machine learning techniques to solve real-world healthcare problems, with an emphasis on practical applications and data-driven insights.

This repository includes the following... 

**1. Datathons.** This section contains scripts and notebooks from various healthcare Datathons, where rapid machine learning solutions are developed to address specific challenges in the field. These projects were done in groups and include: 
- Datathon 1 (Public Health Factors Influencing BMI) 
- Datathon 2 (Mortality & Cardiovascular Disease Complications)
- Datathon 4 (Prediction of mortality in the first 24 hours of Intensive Care Unit admission)
- Datathon 5 (Multi-dimensional time-series data)

*Note that there was no Datathon 3 for this course*

**2. Final Project:** The final project prediction of premature mortality. This project was done in collaboration with Dr. Ijeoma Itany. It includes the following components:
- DummyData_Generation
- DummyData.csv
- Project_Descriptive_Code
- Task1_Final_Code
- Task2_Final_Code
- Task3_Final_Code
- NLP_Final_Code
